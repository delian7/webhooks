This practice app demonstrates simple webhooks.

Whenever the application creates a new user, the user information is POSTed to an endpoint (request.bin) via json.
If /send_users is visited by a browser (GET request) then all of the user information in the database is pushed to the bin.

I used http://requestb.in/ to store the POST requests.
